Short descripton********************************************************************************
	This mod is all about what it would be like as a soldier who is only an inch tall. What kind of action would he see? What new game play stratagies would people make? Would people make  bases and expand or would they move everyting as a convoy? What would happen to "you" if you were a little plastic army man? ... Would you break out a 3D printer and print off tanks? 

Phrase thoughts
	~The helicopter struggled to lift the ruler to bridge the gap for the infantry to bridge the gap

Possible issues
	Players go into freefall animation at certain height
	overall max height for map
	grass causes fps problems at the current size. Huge grass would melt computers
	Lighting - If map is interior only, lighting will be difficult
